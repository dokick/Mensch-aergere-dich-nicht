"""
Behaviour of players:

- First priority is it to get the furthest game piece into one of the final positions,
  no matter the risks or tactical advantages for other game pieces
- If the player rolls a 1, 2 or 3 with the dice the player will use that on game pieces
  that aren't all the way deep in the final positions,
  if there's no tactical disadvantage for other game pieces

Rules:

When can a player/game piece NOT move
- If the player has no game pieces on a playing field (Handled in make_a_move())
- If there are not enough fields that a game piece can move
- If the game piece would land on a field with a game piece of the same color

Implemented Features:

- Player hitting other players
- Rolling the dice three times if no moves available

Not Yet Implemented Features:

- When a player rolls a 6, but his game pieces can't move, a new game piece will come out
- Rolling a 6 leads to making a move again
- Deep check for when a player has won
